# Repository Description

Repository for personal project development, with the main focus being on developing necessary skills and knowledge required in the field.

## Library Project

*No longer in current development*

Was intended as a practice in working with classes and their associated instance variables and methods.

## Budget Project

The budget project is a different way of practicing classes and their associated programming techniques, and the end goal is to build a simple budgeting software. This budgeting software must be able to track expenses and savings, can assign names and categories to each budget, maintain a history of the past budget iterations, have a user-friendly UI, and be an exececutable on the desktop. This project will be done in three phases:

1. Back-end development
2. Front-end UI development
3. Final features and creating the executable

Back-end development includes building the classes and associated methods needed for handling the data the user will input. This also includes a method for saving to and reading from a file to save the data between uses.

Front-end UI development will involve mainly building the UI for the program, and will use Python libraries, the details of which are not yet set.

Lastly, final features will implement any final features that seem relevant to include, and will create a python executable using the relevant libraries so that the program can be run from the desktop, without the use of an IDE.

**Current Progress:** The first phase is almost complete.

## Genome Project

Mostly a fun project, this project aims to analyze a genome, given the base-pair sequence of such. Details are not yet decided upon, but will likely include a frequency analysis, finding any genes and notating them as such, and determining the protein order of the genes.
